## Code Quality Principles

### Method Length and Cleanliness
- **Keep methods short and clean**: Methods should be focused on a single responsibility
- **Extract helper functions**: Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable helper functions
- **Maximum method length**: Aim for methods under 30-40 lines; if longer, consider refactoring
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function should do one thing well

### Code Organization
- **Helper functions**: Use private helper functions (prefixed with `_`) to break down complex operations
- **Clear naming**: Function names should clearly describe what they do
- **Avoid deep nesting**: Use early returns and guard clauses to reduce nesting levels

## Python Style Guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return types
- Keep functions focused and testable
- Prefer composition over complex conditionals
- Use descriptive variable names
